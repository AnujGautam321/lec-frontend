                            Gangs of Wasseypur (stylised as Gangs of वासेपुर)
                            is a 2012 Indian two-part crime film, produced 
                            and directed by Anurag Kashyap,[2] and written
                            by Kashyap and Zeishan Quadri. Centered on the
                            coal mafia (Mafia Raj) of Dhanbad, and the 
                            underlying power struggles, politics and 
                            vengeance between three crime families, the 
                            film features an ensemble cast, with Manoj Bajpai,
                            Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Richa Chadda, Huma Qureshi 
                            and Tigmanshu Dhulia in the major roles. Its story
                            spans from 1941 to 2009. Both parts were originally
                            shot as a single film measuring a total of 321 minutes
                            and screened at the 2012 Cannes Directors' Fortnight
                            ,[3][4][5][6] but, since no Indian theatre would 
                            volunteer to screen a more-than-five-hour film, it
                            was divided into two parts for the Indian market.
